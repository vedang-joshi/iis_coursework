# EMATM0042 Intelligent Information Systems Coursework
This repository is dedicated to host code developed for the EMATM0042 Intelligent Information Systems coursework. The implementation of the considered  scenario is influenced and inspired by the ‘gold-miners’ [1] and ‘cleaning robot’[2] widely known examples of Jason BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture. The Python code involved was completely developed in-house.

## How to run
The easiest way to run this project is to download the Jason IDE, and run the iis_coursework/Part2/Jason-AgentSpeakCode/teacher_student_interactions.mas2j file in the jedit text editor. jedit may be run by opening the `jedit.jar' file in the jason installation.

### Requirements
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) 1.8 or greater is required.
- Download the latest version of [Jason](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jason/).
- The Python code requires version 3.8. We recommend using Anaconda as the preferred package manager. Alternatively, the dependencies may be installed using the iis_coursework/Part1/requirements.txt file.
